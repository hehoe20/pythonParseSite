# pythonParseSite  <br />
This small python script extracts data from skrivunder.net - it takes the link (has to be defines within code) to a collection of signatures and iterates trough pages (range has to be defined within code) with signatures and puts every table with signatures into a single html file.  <br />
Code could be optimized to do parsing even better.  <br />
Script requires beautifulsoup4 and reauests:  <br />
pip install beautifulsoup4  <br />
pip install requests  <br />
